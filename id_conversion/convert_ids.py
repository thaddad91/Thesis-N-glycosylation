Description:  Script to retrieve TAIR ID's to be converted to SwissProt ID's.
              These will be used for sequence-derived characteristics that can
              be found with SwissProt ID's.
"""
# TO-DO: read pickle, single out ID's, convert through SwissProt, append ID's
#        to the table (make sure to look at AT01G00 and AT01G00.1 etc).
